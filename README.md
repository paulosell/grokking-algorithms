# Grokking Algorithms - Learning and Implementation Repository

Welcome to the Grokking Algorithms Learning and Implementation Repository! This repository is dedicated to helping me and you learn and implement the algorithms and concepts presented in the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava.

## About the Book
"Grokking Algorithms" is a beginner-friendly book that introduces fundamental computer science and algorithmic concepts through easy-to-understand explanations and practical examples. This repository is designed to complement my (and yours) learning experience from the book.

## Repository Contents
In this repository, you will find:

- **Code Implementations:** Practical implementations of algorithms and data structures discussed in the book. These implementations are written in C++ programming language. I'm also using CMake to build the implementations.
  
- **Examples:** Real-world examples and use cases for each algorithm, helping you understand their practical applications.

- **Exercises:** Coding exercises and challenges to reinforce your understanding of the algorithms.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/paulosell/grokking-algorithms.git
```

1. Explore the folders and choose the topic you want to start with.

2. Follow the README files within each folder for detailed instructions and explanations.
