# Binary Search 

## Overview

This project implements a simple binary search algorithm in C++. The algorithm searches for a target element in a sorted list.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- CMake (minimum version 3.22.1)
- C++ compiler that supports C++17 standard

## Build Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paulosell/grokking-algorithms.git
   cd binary_search
   ```

2. **Create a Build Directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Generate Build Files:**

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. **Build the Project:**

   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```

   This will compile the project, and the executable will be generated in the `build` directory.

## Run the Executable

After successfully building the project, you can run the executable to perform a binary search:

```bash
./binary_search
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the binary search program.

## Clean Up

To clean up the build files, run the following command from the `build` directory:

```bash
make clean
```

This will remove all the files generated during the build process.
